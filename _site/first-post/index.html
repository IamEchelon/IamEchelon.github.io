I began developing a concept of music composition that hadn’t been done before back in 2009. As I developed this thing it became apparent that in order to do this I was going to need a computer program. I had built assets and diagrams, written out thorough explainations, and described every facet of this language that only existed in my head. But it was stuck in this format and there wasn’t anywhere else I could go at the moment. So I put it to the side.</p> <p>I initially started dabbling in code in 2012. I was working at a dealership and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> had just become a thing. I remember briefly trying <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, which eventually ended up being two of my favorite languages. During that time however, I just really wasn’t dedicated to learning how to code. I was really just exploring to see what programming was all about.</p> <p>Fast forward a few years and there was a resurgence of these music ideas. A component of it that I’d had trouble with all of a sudden became crystal clear. I knew that If this was going to happen I needed to get serious and I needed to do it now. I struggled for the first year. I started out learning Javascript, and then in June of 2014 Apple announced Swift out of nowhere at WWDC. I didn’t know much, but I knew I wanted to be on mobile devices more than anything. So I began learning Swift in earnest. I slowly found out that with Swift being such a new language I was standing on shaky ground. It didn’t help that I didn’t find Swift to be a particularly easy language to learn. So I had to change my approach.</p> <p>Something made me double back to Ruby. I remember liking the syntax and when I went back to it I’d discovered that it was way easier for me to wrap my mind around it’s concepts than Swift. I didn’t need to understand the difference between a Struct and a Class because there were only classes. I didn’t need to know the difference between functions and methods because there were only methods. So it was with this simplicity in mind that I dove into learning Ruby.</p> <p>Jumping forward a couple of months I was completely absorbed in the process of self teaching, but I felt like I wasn’t getting anywhere skill wise. I saw something about coding bootcamps but everything seemed to be priced far out of my budget. That’s when <a href="https://launchschool.com/">LaunchSchool</a> seemed to pop up out of nowhere. I’m eternally grateful that they did. They had great reviews and they seemed to be decently priced. I would be cutting it close financially to enroll in this course but I had to try.</p> <p>As I worked through the course material I was having small epiphanies every day. Then one day during one of the course projects everything just kind of clicked for me. Concepts that had eluded me before were suddenly crystal clear. And the first thing I did was build a skeleton for my original idea. It was at that point I started believing that maybe I could really do this.</p> <h2 id="to-be-continued"><strong><em>to be continued….</em></strong></h2> <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/first-post/" class="btn btn_twitter" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/first-post/" class="btn btn_facebook" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/first-post/" class="btn btn_google-plus" title="Share on Google Plus"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-google-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Google+</span></a> </div> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://localhost:4000/images/project-images/rlt.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://raleighlittletheatre.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Raleigh Little Theater </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(http://localhost:4000/images/project-images/newkind.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://newkind.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> New Kind </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
