Coding kind of happened to me from a series of cosmic coincidences. I had begun developing this concept of music composition that had never been done before, and somewhere along the way it became very apparent that in order to do this I would need a computer program. Initially I tried to find someone that would be able to code what I was seeing. I had built assets and diagrams, written out thorough explainations, and described every facet of this language that only existed in my head. Unfortunately for me (or fortunately, I'm not sure which) it became immediately apparent that I would have to build this thing, myself, from scratch and thus began my journey.

I initially started dabbling in code in 2012. I was working at a dealership and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) had just become a thing. I remember briefly trying [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) which are both to this day two of my favorite languages. But during that time I just really wasn't dedicated to learning the craft, I was really just exploring to see what programming was all about.

Fast forward a few years and there was a resurgence of these music ideas. A component of it that I'd had trouble with all of a sudden became crystal clear. If this was going to happen I needed to get serious and I needed to do it now. I struggled mightily for the first year. I started out learning Javascript, then in June of 2014 Apple announced Swift out of nowhere at WWDC. I knew I wanted to be on mobile devices more than anything so I began learning Swift but with Swift being such a new language over time it became apparent I was standing on shaky ground. It didn't help that I didn't find Swift to be a particularly easy language to learn.

Something made me double back to Ruby. I remember liking the syntax and when I went back to it I'd discovered that it was way easier for me to wrap my mind around it's concepts than Swift. I didn't need to understand the difference between a Struct and a Class because there were only classes. I didn't need to know the difference between functions and methods there were only methods. So it was with this simplicity in mind that I dove into learning Ruby. 

I was in the middle of one of my long self teaching stints and I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere skill wise. I saw something about coding bootcamps but everything seemed to be priced far out of my budget. And then this God send, [LaunchSchool](https://launchschool.com/) popped up out of nowhere. They had great reviews and they seemed to be decently priced. Even if I would be cutting it close financially. Speaking of finances my bank account was on fumes by this point. I had left my job at Verizon to pursue this and my runway was running out. So this had to help me in my development or I was in trouble. Luckily for me this was the thing that made programming click for me. All of a sudden I understood how to do things that had previously escaped me. It felt like I had developed a super power.

Unfortunately for me once I had completed the part of the course that introduced the front end I couldn't afford the rest of the course that dove further into Rails development. So I took the skills that I'd developed both in Ruby and in Javascript and began developing my first site.
